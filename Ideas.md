> OTPs are sensitive data, right? Why not make 'em encrypted and make it so that they can be decrypted only by the app that is meant to decrypt them. Like Paytm app could only decrypt the OTP for Paytm, neither any other app nor a human should be able to decipher what the OTP is. That way OTP cannot be read by other malicious apps and services.
